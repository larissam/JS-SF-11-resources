DOM manipulation: Making a favorites list

Write code to enhance the favorites list in the following ways:
- When a user clicks the submit button, take the value they've typed in the input box and add it to the list (remember: appendChild)
- Also, when a new item is added to the list, clear the input box.  
*/

// STEP 1
// Create a variable that equals the submit button element in the DOM.

// STEP 2
// Add an event listener to the submit button you selected in the previous step. 
// When the user clicks on the submit button, you should: 
    // - prevent browser from doing the default action (submitting the form and refreshing the page)
    // - create a new list item
    // - set its value to be whatever the user typed in the input box (use the `value` property)
    // - append the new list item to the unordered list in the DOM
    // - clear the input box   (Hint: the `value` property of the input box, before anyone types in it, is an empty string.)

BONUS:
When a user clicks submit without typing anything, alert the user "You must type in a value!"
